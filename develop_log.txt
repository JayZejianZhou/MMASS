2020.12.14 -- add PyCharm support
    1. the ROS tutorial:  http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs
        Edit the ros desktop edit is not available, change to
        bash -i -c "/snap/pycharm-professional/226/bin/pycharm.sh" %f
        or the directory "226" can be changed according to the versions.
        See this https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360003296119-Integrating-ROS-with-Pycharm
        This command line needs to be run every time you want to start PyCharm with ROS
    2. test with ROS_tutorial.
        1) Make catkin work space
        2) under "src/" directory clone from Github.
            git clone https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git
        3) run the python tutorials
    3. New class and structures:
        Agent -- with or without learning function?

    1. the @ operator equals to np.dot() after Python 3.5
    2. animation: remove previous surf to speed up.
    3. when initializing FPK instant, let the drag to be around 1e-10
    4. why drag=1e-20 is super slow

    1. +To construct a ROS python package, you need to first use
        catkin_create_pkg "package name" rospy
        to construct a package folder. The package has to be under the main project src/ folder

        +Then, add "__init__.py" and "setup.py" under the package root folder so it looks like
        --my package
            --subpackage1
                --__init__.py
                --fun1.py
                --fun2,py
            --subpackage2
            --__init__.py
            --setup.py

        +Edit those two files
        +In the "CMakeLists.txt" file, enable this line
            catkin_python_setup()
        +catkin_make
        +source devel/setup.bash  You have to source the command window every time you wanna import the package
        +import the package

        see http://docs.ros.org/en/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/installing_python.html

    2. To make a rosrun script possible
        +chmod u+x "script name"
        +In "CMakeLists.txt", enable
            catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS "script name"
          DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})
         +rosrun my_pkg hello

    1. You have to mark the src folder as source
    2. Transfer to ROS2 for MAS support
        activate virtual environment:
        legal ROS base name
            source venveROS2/bin/activate
